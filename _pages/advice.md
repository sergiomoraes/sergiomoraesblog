I have been working as a 'data professional' for about 5 years no, give or take. During those years, I've experienced multiple types of scenarios involving Data Management programs.
<br>
However, most of my focus was (and still is) directed at the Data Governance and Data Quality aspects of Data Management. These are very small pieces of the whole but are also quite often the starting place (if not the ending) of data-centric programs in many organizations.
<br>
I am very enthusiastic about Data Governance and Data Quality, and I enjoy helping others build and deploy well-thought-out data programs.
