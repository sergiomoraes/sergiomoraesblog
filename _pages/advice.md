I've been dedicated to work in the Data Management field for several years. During those years, I had the opportunity to experience multiple challenges in companies big and small.
<br>
<br>
A big part of my focus was (and still is) directed at the Data Governance and Data Quality aspects of Data Management. Being often the starting place of data-centric programs in many organizations, these subject areas can set the foundation to improving an organization's data architecture, but also its data culture.
<br>
<br>
I am very enthusiastic about Data Management, and I enjoy helping others build and deploy well-thought-out data programs.
