On this site, I share my personal thoughts around technology, data, and personal projects. I'm a Data Governance & Data Quality professional, and I like to spend my time thinking about technology and how it influences our lives.

Reach out to me if you'd like to talk about anything data, enterprise project management methodologies, or computer science.

My preferred contact method is email. Send one through <a href="https://sergiomoraes.dev/advice">this form</a>.
